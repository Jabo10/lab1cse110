# Jeremy Abondano

My name is Jeremy Abondano. I do not consider myself a programmer, I just wanted to go to school and challenge myself. I chose to study computer science on a whim but do not see myself in a career in this field, to be completely honest I want nothing to do with it. I do not have anything to show for so here is a picture of some clouds and the most basic use of markdown.
